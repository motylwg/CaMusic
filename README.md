CaMusic
-------

Cellular automata generated music.

[Cellular Automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) (CA) are discrete dynamical systems useful for modelling complex systems.
In his studies of CA, Wolfram relied heavily on the use of human perception to categorize the possibly behaviors of CA and other simply defined systems.

This project is a minimalistic attempt to leverage human aural perception by rendering CA evolution as music using the [JFugue](http://jfugue.org/) music API.
The results can be surprisingly musical.
